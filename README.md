Implementing pieces of the Google Maps API from scratch

Scenarios:

1. Search Google Maps for places or locations. Go to map.html to use this feature.
2. Get directions to various places from another location. This is not turn-by-turn navigation. Our functionality essentially allows you view a route from your "from" address to your "to" address. Go to map.html to use this feature.
3. Log into the site. This will change both the behavior and the way certain pages look on the site. This enables users to view information about their account on an Account Information page. Done using OAuth. These features are in login.html and account.html.
4. Store information about frequently visited locations. Can view this information on an alternative map. Implemented using a map from D3.JS.
