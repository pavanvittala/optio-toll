# optio-toll
SWE 432 Web Development Project

Optio-Toll enables users to get a better picture of how much they are spending when they use tolls. Services like Google Maps enable users to travel to destinations using tolls, but they dont let the user know  how much a certain toll costs or how much they are spending in total on tolls on a given route. Optio-Toll gives users this functionality.

Scenarios:

1. Create an account on the Optio-Toll website using your email address.
2. Search Google Maps for places or locations and get directions to various places from your current location. This is not turn-by-turn navigation. Our functionality essentially allows you view all the routes from your from address to your destination.
3. Log into the site. This will change both the behavior and the way certain pages look on the site. This enables users to view information about their account on an Account Information page.
4. View toll data on a route: how much you'd end up paying if you took that route and whether or not there are cheaper routes around you. We will visualize this toll data using D3.js. The template we've chosen is "Multiple Bar Charts". With this we'll be able to display multiple metrics for each route (price, length of route, time to traverse route, etc.). You will also be able to store information about frequently visited locations or saved locations as a user of the site with an account.
