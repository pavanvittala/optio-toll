SWE 432 Web Development Project

Optio-Toll enables users to get a better picture of how much they are spending when they use tolls. Services like Google Maps enable users to travel to destinations using tolls, but they dont let the user know  how much a certain toll costs or how much they are spending in total on tolls on a given route. Optio-Toll gives users this functionality.

Scenarios:

1. Create an account on the Optio-Toll website using your email address.
2. Search Google Maps for places or locations and get directions to various places from your current location.
3. Log into the site. This enables users to store information about frequently visited locations or saved locations such as their workplace or home.
4. View toll data on a route: how much you'd end up paying if you took that route and whether or not there are cheaper routes around you.
