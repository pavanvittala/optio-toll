# optio-toll
SWE 432 Web Development Project

Optio-Toll enables users to get a better picture of how much they are spending when they use tolls. Services like Google Maps enable users to travel to destinations using tolls, but they dont let the user know  how much a certain toll costs or how much they are spending in total on tolls on a given route. Optio-Toll gives users this functionality.

Scenarios:

1. Create an account on the Optio-Toll website using your email address.
2. Search Google Maps for places or locations and get directions to various places from your current location. This is not turn-by-turn navigation. Our functionality essentially allows you view all the routes from your from address to your destination.
3. Log into the site. This will change both the behavior and the way certain pages look on the site. This enables users to view information about their account on an Account Information page.
4. Store information about frequently visited locations. Can view this information on an alternative map. Implemented using a map from D3.JS.
5. Have a history of recently visited locations.
6. Be able to click on the map to drop pins. Can be used to find the distance between two locations.
