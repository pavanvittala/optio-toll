# optio-toll
SWE 432 Web Development Project

Implementing pieces of the Google Maps API from scratch.

Scenarios:

1. Create an account on the Optio-Toll website using your email address.
2. Search Google Maps for places or locations and get directions to various places from your current location. This is not turn-by-turn navigation. Our functionality essentially allows you view all the routes from your from address to your destination.
3. Log into the site. This will change both the behavior and the way certain pages look on the site. This enables users to view information about their account on an Account Information page.
4. Store information about frequently visited locations. Can view this information on an alternative map. Implemented using a map from D3.JS.
5. Have a history of location searches.
